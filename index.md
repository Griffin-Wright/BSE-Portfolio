# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second Milestone didn't include much, as at this point I was still waiting for replacement Bluetooth modules to connect my motors to the gyro, but I did some work on fixing the gyro, ensuring it gave accurate information. Fixing the gyro involved a lot of messing around with the sensitivity of the axis, along with switching the directionality of it. Soon after this milestone a lot of the code got deleted due to an accidental crash, leading to a lot of it being rewritten and a few developments as a result.

# First Milestone  
My first Milestone was hooking up the motors to the H-Bridge motor controller, along with developing basic code to recognize information sent in the Serial reader of the Arduino Uno. I set the motors up so that when I input a w command, they would all move forward, an s would move them back, an a would move them to the left and a d would move them to the right. This was likely the easiest portion of the project, but at this point it was still controlled from my computer, something that in the end I would have to change. I also set up the Arduino micro to a gyro an accelerometer, which would notice the information of distance and rotation and turn it into readable 'w', 's', 'a', or 'd' commands that would later be read by the Arduino Uno and send information to the motors.
