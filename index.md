Gesture Controlled Car

Over 2 and a half weeks, I built a chassis/car that could recieve information from a breadboard on my hand through bluetooth, using this given rotation information to move in different directions. It also includes a screen which could show distance and rotation information, an ultrasonic sensor that can sense walls in front of the car, 4 motors and many other parts.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was somewhat bittersweet, as although I did finish the gesture controlled car, learning more about code than I had ever before, there were some unforseen issues that occured largely as a result of timing or more mechanical problems that prevented it from living up to my standards. The main issue was the wheels, which took 4+ hours to attatch, only to ultimately fail and prevent the car from fully functioning. Since the second milestone I spent a day attatching the new bluetooth sensors, which was difficult but eventually worked, and also attatching the wheels, which (as I've already with coding and problem solving, two skills that possibly weren't extremely present with me before.

# Second Milestone
My second Milestone didn't include much, as at this point I was still waiting for replacement Bluetooth modules to connect my motors to the gyro, but I did some work on fixing the gyro, ensuring it gave accurate information. Fixing the gyro involved a lot of messing around with the sensitivity of the axis, along with switching the directionality of it. Soon after this milestone a lot of the code got deleted due to an accidental crash, leading to a lot of it being rewritten and a few developments as a result.

# First Milestone  
My first Milestone was hooking up the motors to the H-Bridge motor controller, along with developing basic code to recognize information sent in the Serial reader of the Arduino Uno. I set the motors up so that when I input a w command, they would all move forward, an s would move them back, an a would move them to the left and a d would move them to the right. This was likely the easiest portion of the project, but at this point it was still controlled from my computer, something that in the end I would have to change. I also set up the Arduino micro to a gyro an accelerometer, which would notice the information of distance and rotation and turn it into readable 'w', 's', 'a', or 'd' commands that would later be read by the Arduino Uno and send information to the motors.
